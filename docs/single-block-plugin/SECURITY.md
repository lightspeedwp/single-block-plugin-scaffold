# Security Policy

The security of {{projectName}} is a top priority. This document outlines our security practices, how to report vulnerabilities, and what users can expect from our security process.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| {{version}} (latest) | ✅ |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ |
| < 1.0   | ❌ |

Only the latest major version receives security updates. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the latest version.

## Security Standards

### Development Security

Our development process includes multiple security measures:

#### Code Review
- **All code changes** are reviewed by maintainers
- **Security-focused reviews** for authentication and data handling
- **Automated security scanning** via GitHub Advanced Security
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning** for all packages

#### Secure Coding Practices
- **Input validation** and sanitization for all user data
- **Output escaping** to prevent XSS attacks
- **SQL injection prevention** using prepared statements
- **CSRF protection** using WordPress nonces
- **Capability checks** for all privileged operations

#### Testing
- **Automated security tests** in CI/CD pipeline
- **Regular dependency audits** using npm audit and composer audit
- **Static code analysis** using PHPStan and ESLint security rules
- **Manual security testing** before major releases

### WordPress Security Integration

The plugin leverages WordPress's built-in security features:

#### Data Handling
```php
// Input sanitization
$content = sanitize_text_field( $_POST['content'] );

// Output escaping
echo esc_html( $user_content );

// Database queries
$wpdb->prepare( "SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = %d", $id );
```

#### Permissions and Capabilities
```php
// Capability checks
if ( ! current_user_can( 'edit_posts' ) ) {
    wp_die( __( 'You do not have permission to access this page.' ) );
}

// Nonce verification
if ( ! wp_verify_nonce( $_POST['nonce'], 'action_name' ) ) {
    wp_die( __( 'Security check failed.' ) );
}
```

#### Content Security
- **Content filtering** using `wp_kses()` for HTML content
- **URL validation** using `esc_url()`
- **Attribute escaping** using `esc_attr()`
- **Script/style enqueueing** using WordPress APIs

## Vulnerability Categories

We take the following types of vulnerabilities seriously:

### Critical Severity
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**
- **SQL Injection**
- **Authentication bypasses**
- **Privilege escalation**
- **Data exfiltration**

### High Severity
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
- **Directory traversal**
- **Sensitive data exposure**
- **Insecure deserialization**

### Medium Severity
- **Information disclosure**
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**
- **Weak cryptography**
- **Session management flaws**
- **Access control issues**

### Low Severity
- **Security misconfigurations**
- **Insecure headers**
- **Missing security flags**
- **Information leakage**

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report

**⚠️ Important**: Do NOT report security vulnerabilities in public GitHub issues, forums, or social media.

#### Preferred Method: Private GitHub Security Advisory

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/{{author}}/{{slug}}/security) of our repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form with details
4. Submit the report

#### Alternative Method: Email

Send security reports to: **security@{{author}}.com**

Use this PGP key for sensitive information:
```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[PGP Key would go here in a real implementation]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```
